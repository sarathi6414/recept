       <h1><b>Instructions for Making Biryani</b></h1>
        <h4>First, marinate your protein of choice (chicken, mutton, beef, fish, or vegetables) by mixing it with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder, garam masala, salt, and lemon juice. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes or overnight in the refrigerator for enhanced flavor.

            Next, prepare the rice. Rinse 2 cups of basmati rice until the water runs clear. In a large pot, bring 4 cups of water to a boil, adding salt, bay leaves, a cinnamon stick, green cardamom pods, and cloves. Add the rice and cook until it's about 70-80% done, then drain and set aside.
            
            For the biryani masala, heat 4 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a large pan. Fry thinly sliced onions until they turn golden brown. Add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and saut√© until fragrant. Mix in chopped tomatoes, slit green chilies, and 2 tablespoons of biryani masala powder, cooking until the oil separates from the mixture. Add the marinated protein and cook until it is almost done.
            
            To layer the biryani, use a heavy-bottomed pot or biryani handi. Start with a layer of the cooked protein mixture, then add a layer of the parboiled rice. Sprinkle fresh mint leaves, chopped coriander leaves, fried onions, and saffron milk over the rice. Repeat the layers, finishing with a layer of rice and garnishes.
            
            Seal the pot with aluminum foil or a dough seal, then cover it with a lid. Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.
            
            Finally, gently fluff the biryani with a fork and serve hot, garnished with additional fried onions and fresh herbs. Enjoy your aromatic and flavorful biryani with a side of raita or salad.</h4>
